# MBP Games accounts

One account for every MBP game: players sign in once with their email and their progress in each game is saved to it. A Cloudflare Worker with a D1 database, at **https://accounts.atlesque.dev**.

This folder lives in the Scrum City repo for now and has nothing to do with the game's code, so it can move to its own repository as it is.

## What players see

- **`/signin`**: the hosted sign-in every game sends players to. They type their email and get a link; opening it (on any device) and pressing **Sign in** confirms the address, creates the account the first time, and signs them in. The tab that asked carries on by itself and goes back to the game. Already signed in on this site? It's one click ("Continue as …"), which is the single sign-on part.
- **`/`**: the account hub: who you're signed in as and the games you've played.
- **`/admin`**: for the emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS`: every player with their games and progress, and buttons to reset a game's progress, ban or unban, and sign a player out everywhere. Every admin action is logged on the player's page.

There are no passwords. A link works once and runs out after 15 minutes; an email can ask for 5 links per 15 minutes and an IP for 20 per hour.

## Adding a game

1. Add it to `GAMES` in `src/clients.js`: an id, its name and URL, the `origins` its pages are served from (they're allowed to send players to `/signin`, get them back, and call the API), and a `summary(save)` for the admin page.
2. In the game, send players to sign in and sync their save. `public/js/core/account.js` in the Scrum City repo is a complete client to copy.

### The flow, for a game

1. Make a random `code_verifier` and its `code_challenge` = base64url(SHA-256(verifier)), plus a random `state`; keep them in `localStorage`.
2. Send the player to `https://accounts.atlesque.dev/signin?client=<game id>&redirect_uri=<this page>&state=<state>&code_challenge=<challenge>`.
3. They come back to `redirect_uri` with `?mbpg_code=…&mbpg_state=…`. Check the state, then `POST /api/token` with `{ code, code_verifier, client, redirect_uri }` to get `{ token, user: { id, email }, expiresAt }`. Tokens last 90 days.
4. Send the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`:
   - `GET /api/me` → `{ user }`
   - `GET /api/games/<game>/progress` → `{ data, rev, updatedAt }` (`data` is `null` before the first save, or after an admin reset)
   - `PUT /api/games/<game>/progress` with `{ data, rev }`, where `rev` is the one you last read or wrote (0 for none). Answers `{ rev }`, or **409** with the account's current `{ data, rev }` when it moved on without you (another device, an admin reset): adopt that copy. Saves are JSON objects up to 64 KB.
   - `POST /api/logout` ends the token.
   - **401** means the token is gone (signed out everywhere); **403** with `error: "banned"` means the account is banned and `message` says why.

## Running it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # local database + http://localhost:8787; emails aren't sent, they're saved under .wrangler/tmp/email
npm test         # from the repo root: npm test runs these with the game's tests
npm run deploy   # applies new migrations to the real database, then deploys
```

Point a local copy of the game at it with `?debug&accounts=http://localhost:8787`. From the repo root, `node tests/account-shots.mjs <folder>` plays the whole flow in a browser (guest, sign-in, sync on death, admin reset and ban) and saves screenshots.

## Cloudflare setup

- **D1 database** `mbp-games` (id in `wrangler.jsonc`). Schema changes are new files in `migrations/`.
- **Email**: Cloudflare Email Service, with `atlesque.dev` onboarded for sending (Compute → Email Service → Email Sending). Mail comes from `noreply@atlesque.dev`; the binding is restricted to that sender.
- **Secret** `ADMIN_EMAILS`: comma-separated emails that can open `/admin`. Set it in the Worker's settings (or `wrangler secret put ADMIN_EMAILS`).
- **Domain**: `accounts.atlesque.dev`, a custom domain on the Worker (from `routes` in `wrangler.jsonc`).
- A cron at 03:17 UTC clears out expired links, codes and sign-ins.
